  The first time I listened to this album, I made it through the first song, "All Delighted People," thinking it was the first three songs of the album.
  Of course the song is nearly twelve minutes long, but it also features an incredible variety of sounds. It does not approach the realm of "boring" at all, which
  is an astounding feat for a track of such length. From the very beginning, listeners are sent on an auditory adventure for the ages. Like Mario wall-jumping up a vertical passage, 
  "All Delighted People" switches between a variety of emotions with serenity, cheerfulness, organized chaos, and intensity.

  Once you finish an opening track which is twelve minutes long, you don't expect it to come up again, right? Well it does in <i>All Delighted People</i> with a classic rock variety just 
  five songs later. Somehow, with twenty minutes of basically the same song, Stevens manages to keep it interesting. Both versions of the same song are great, but they are made better
  by the four songs in between. "Enchanting Ghost" is a nice relaxing song to follow up the dramatic opener. "From the Mouth of Gabriel" introduces fun sounds that were unheard up to 
  this point in the album. "The Owl and the Tanager" emits notes of nostalgia. But the real star here is "Heirloom." "Heirloom" is the shortest and simplest song on 
  the album, but it is brilliant on its own. It features one of the most calming melodies that I've heard which brings me back to it again and again.

  Jumping ahead to "Arnika," which follows the second iteration of "All Delighted People," listeners are greeted with yet another fun track. The song features many of the ideas heard 
  elsewhere in the album, and fits right in. It is followed by "Djohariah." If you thought the twelve minute opener was long, you'll be shocked at the seventeen minute long closing track.
  It begins with quite the build up: an intro a few seconds longer than the entire first song. The intro on its own is pretty nice, but the song finishes with a slightly more standard,
  yet incredibly flowy format, which brings it all together.

  This album is an adventure. It is filled with masterfully overlapping melodies and unique sounds. It is perfect for when you want to sit down and really listen to some great music,
  or when you just want something nice playing in the background as you work. I find myself repeatedly returning to <i>All Delighted People</i>.
